We release tons of resources, including source files like "Shadow UI" in our <a href="https://discord.gg/v4ZTG26h4j" target="_blank">Discord Server</a>, so be sure to check us out.

## What is Shadow-UI?

This is a project that was made specifically for <b>Shadow</b> and then skids like the developers of Nihon got ahold of it, so I decided to release it for free to the public. This was a project that cost the Shadow team roughly $120 to have designed and then resold to other individuals without permission as we paid for complete rights over the interface from the interface designer.
